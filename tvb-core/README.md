# TVB Core 

TVB core packages are two:

        pip install tvb-library
        pip install tvb-framework
        
Our source code is available here: <https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-root>

The notebooks under this folder are for public share, to be used from HBP Collab space.
They could also easily be adapted for local usages (after download, preparation of a local Python3  env, 
and maybe small adjustments in data access).
Raw TVB demo IPython Notebooks can be found under:
