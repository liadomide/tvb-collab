# The Virtual Brain

"The Virtual Brain" Project (TVB Project) has the purpose of offering 
modern tools to the Neurosciences community, for computing, simulating
and analyzing functional and structural data of human brains, brains modeled 
at the  level of population of neurons.

### TVB Core 

To **install** locally TVB code on your machine, we recommend you to first create a dedicated 
 Python env, and afterwards to take our main Pypi released packages:

        pip install tvb-library
        pip install tvb-framework
   
Alternatively and easier, you could simply download **TVB_Distribution** from:
<https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei/brainsimulator-software>. In this
variant, you will have Python, TVB and all our 3rd party dependencies downloaded together, 
you do not need to do anything else other than unzip and double click on **tvb_start** command.

More details on our documentation site: <http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org>.
